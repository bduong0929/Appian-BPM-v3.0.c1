# Computer fundamentals - Type of memory

Memory is the most essential element of a computing system because without it computer can’t perform simple tasks.
Computer memory is of two basic types – Primary memory(RAM and ROM) and Secondary memory (hard drive, CD, etc). Random
Access Memory (RAM) is primary-volatile memory and Read-Only Memory (ROM) is primary-non-volatile memory.

## Random Access Memory (RAM) –

- It is also called read-write memory or the main memory or the primary memory.
- The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory. It is a
- volatile memory as the data is lost when the power is turned off.
- RAM is further classified into two types- SRAM (
  Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).

## Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- Stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer.
- It is not volatile.
- Always retains its data.
- Used in embedded systems or where the programming needs no change.
- Used in calculators and peripheral devices.
- ROM is further classified into four types- MROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.

## Types of Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- PROM (Programmable read-only memory) – It can be programmed by the user. Once programmed, the data and instructions in
  it cannot be changed.
- EPROM (Erasable Programmable read-only memory) – It can be reprogrammed. To erase data from it, expose it to
  ultraviolet light. To reprogram it, erase all the previous data.
- EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) – The data can be erased by applying an electric field,
  with no need for ultraviolet light. We can erase only portions of the chip.
- MROM(Mask ROM) – Mask ROM is a kind of read-only memory, that is masked off at the time of production. Like other
  types of ROM, mask ROM cannot enable the user to change the data stored in it. If it can, the process would be
  difficult or slow.

# Environment variables

An environment variable is a dynamic value that the operating system and other software can use to determine information
specific to your computer.

In other words, an environment variable is something that represents something else, like a location on your computer, a
version number, a list of objects, etc.

Environment variables are surrounded by the percent sign (%), as in %temp%, to distinguish them from regular text.

Two types of environment variables exist: user environment variables and system environment variables.

# Operating system fundamentals

An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a
software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input
and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

Following are some of important functions of an operating System.

- Memory Management
- Processor Management
- Device Management
- File Management
- Security
- Control over system performance
- Job accounting
- Error detecting aids
- Coordination between other software and users

Applications of Operating System

Following are some important activities that an Operating System performs :

- **Security** − By means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to programs and data.

- **Control over system performance** − Recording delays between request for a service and response from the system.

- **Job accounting** − Keeping track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.

- **Error detecting aids** − Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error detecting aids.

- **Coordination between other pieces of software and users** − Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers
  and other software to the various users of the computer systems.
