# Computer fundamentals - Type of memory

Memory is the most essential element of a computing system because without it computer can’t perform simple tasks.
Computer memory is of two basic types – Primary memory(RAM and ROM) and Secondary memory (hard drive, CD, etc). Random
Access Memory (RAM) is primary-volatile memory and Read-Only Memory (ROM) is primary-non-volatile memory.

## Random Access Memory (RAM) –

- It is also called read-write memory or the main memory or the primary memory.
- The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory. It is a
- volatile memory as the data is lost when the power is turned off. 
- RAM is further classified into two types- SRAM (
  Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).

## Read-Only Memory (ROM)

- Stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer.
- It is not volatile.
- Always retains its data.
- Used in embedded systems or where the programming needs no change.
- Used in calculators and peripheral devices.
- ROM is further classified into four types- MROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM. 

## Types of Read-Only Memory (ROM)
- PROM (Programmable read-only memory) – It can be programmed by the user. Once programmed, the data and instructions in it cannot be changed. 
- EPROM (Erasable Programmable read-only memory) – It can be reprogrammed. To erase data from it, expose it to ultraviolet light. To reprogram it, erase all the previous data. 
- EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) – The data can be erased by applying an electric field, with no need for ultraviolet light. We can erase only portions of the chip.
- MROM(Mask ROM) – Mask ROM is a kind of read-only memory, that is masked off at the time of production. Like other types of ROM, mask ROM cannot enable the user to change the data stored in it. If it can, the process would be difficult or slow.
